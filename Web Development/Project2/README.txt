Project 2

My Project 2 adds CSS styling and some JavaScript to my "bucket map" website started in Project 2. I added a gallery page with animated images and video from travel experiences, and updated each of the other pages with CSS styling so that they appear much more like a normal, functional website. The map page itself did not change much, simply because embedding a map API is above the skill level of this class.

Some of the primary new features added to the original project include CSS animations, background colors and images, and grid/flex layouts to various page elements. The menu bar now indicates to the user which page they're currently located on. I also included several :hover styles, and accounted for smaller screen sizes on several elements. 

The javascript function on this website allows users to add their own places they'd like to visit to the list on the Lists page. The user inputs that place into a form, which adds the form content to an li within the specified list.
